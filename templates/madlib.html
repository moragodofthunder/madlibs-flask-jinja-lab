        <p>There once was a person named {{ subject }}

            that they painted {{ color }} strapped to their 
            {% for bodypart in bodyparts %}<li>{{ bodypart }}</li>{% endfor %}.
            
            The townsfolk would cry "Why {{ subject }}, why?!"
            And {{ subject }} would sing {{ adjective }} "It's fun
            that I'm after, and so I cannot deny, that the most fun thing
            to do is run around town as am I!"</p>
